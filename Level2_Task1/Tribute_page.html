        <h1>About Rohit Sharma</h1><br>
        <li>Rohit Sharma, the Indian cricketer, is a person who has truly inspired me in many ways. As a cricket enthusiast and a fan of the game, his journey in the sport has been nothing short of remarkable. His achievements on the field and his dedication to the game have made him an inspiration to countless individuals, including myself.</li><br>
        <li>One of the reasons why Rohit Sharma has inspired me is his ability to bounce back from adversity. Throughout his career, he has faced many challenges and setbacks, but he has always managed to come back stronger than ever. This resilience and determination are qualities that I admire and strive to emulate in my own life. Whether he has been faced with a poor run of form, injuries, or criticism from fans and experts, he has always managed to overcome these obstacles and emerge victorious. This has taught me the importance of perseverance and the belief that one should never give up, no matter how tough the situation may be.</li><br>
        <li>Rohit Sharma's consistency and ability to perform under pressure have been a source of inspiration for me. He has time and again delivered match-winning performances when his team needed him the most. His calm and composed demeanor in high-pressure situations is something that I truly admire. This has taught me the importance of maintaining composure and staying focused, even in the most challenging of situations.</li><br>
        <li>Rohit Sharma's success has not come easily. He has put in years of hard work, dedication, and practice to reach the level of excellence that he has achieved today. His commitment to the game serves as a reminder that success does not come overnight and that one must be prepared to put in the effort and time required to achieve their goals.</li><br>

His ability to remain calm under pressure and make crucial decisions has made me realize the importance of being a strong and effective leader in any aspect of life.</li><br>
        <li>Sharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international match, with a remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November 2014.He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket.In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.</li><br>
        <li>On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.In the same series, he broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.</li><br>
        <li>On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international sixes (553).His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, allowed him to reach this milestone with 556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.</li><br>
        <li>On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format.This feat occurred during a highly anticipated India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 100,000 enthusiastic fans.The Indian skipper's ability to consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant Strokeplay has made him a dynamic force in limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies his status as one of India's premier batsmen and a cricketing legend.</li><br>
        <li>In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for India in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by Australia. Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final against Bangladesh.</li><br>
        <li>On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 World Cup in England.In the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international cricket.He followed it up with centuries against Pakistan, England and Bangladesh. In the match against Sri Lanka, hitting yet another century, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup tournament,and equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries (6) in all World Cup matches.Sharma totalled 648 runs in the tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award, the third Indian player to do so.</li><br>
        <li>Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in Belfast on 23 June 2007. This was part of the 2007 Future Cup competition which also involved South Africa. He was number seven in the batting order but did not bat as India won the game by 9 wickets.</li><br>
        <li>He scored his maiden ODI half-century (52) against Pakistan at Jaipur on 18 November 2007 and was selected for the Indian squad going to the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia.In that series, he scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, including 66 in the first final at Sydney when he partnered Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase.After that, however, his ODI performances suffered a downturn and he lost his middle-order position to Suresh Raina. Later, Virat Kohli took his position as the reserve batsman. In December 2009, following his triple century in the Ranji Trophy, he was recalled to the ODI team for the tri-nations tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest in the series.</li><br>
        <li>He scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010 and followed it up with another century in the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring 101 not out.He had a run of poor form in South Africa just before the 2011 World Cup and as a consequence he was left out of India's squad for the tournament.</li><br>
        <li>Sharma was recalled to the limited-overs squad for the tour of the West Indies in June and July 2011.In the first match at Queen's Park Oval, he scored 68 (not out) from 75 balls with three fours and a six. In the third match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, he scored a match-winning 86 off 91 balls after India had been reduced to 92 for 6.</li><br>
        <li>He had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 runs in the whole calendar year at the very low average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni showed faith in him, and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting order to open the innings with Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a success and India won the competition, defeating hosts England in the final.</li><br>
        <li>His good form continued and, later in the year against Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur. He followed that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a then-world record for the most sixes (16) in a one-day international innings (since beaten by Eoin Morgan of England with 17).On 13 November 2014, playing against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the world record for the highest score in a one-day international innings with 264 from 173 deliveries.</li><br>
        <li>In December 2017, India's captain Virat Kohli was rested for the series against Sri Lanka, in preparation for India's tour to South Africa, which began in the first week of January 2018. In his place, Sharma was appointed team captain and India under his leadership won the series 2–1, their eighth consecutive series win since defeating Zimbabwe in June 2016.Sharma also hit his third ODI double-century in this series, scoring 208 (not out) to extend his record of most ODI double-centuries by a player.</li><br>
        <li>In September 2018, in the absence of many top players including regular captain Virat Kohli, Sharma led India to win the 2018 Asia Cup, where they defeated Bangladesh in the final.</li><br>
        <li>On 12 January 2019, in the opening match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sharma scored 133 but it was in vain as India lost by 34 runs. It was his 22nd century in one-day internationals.At Delhi on 13 March 2019, in the fifth and final match of a home series against Australia, Sharma scored 56 including his 8,000th run in one-day internationals. It was his 200th innings.In 2019, he scored the most runs in ODIs by any batsman, with 1,490 runs in the calendar year, including 7 centuries.</li><br>
        <li>In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade award.</li><br>
        <li>Sharma was included in the Indian squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and made his mark by scoring an unbeaten 50 from 40 deliveries against hosts South Africa in the quarter-finals. This enabled India to win the match by 37 runs and they went on to defeat Pakistan in the final, when Sharma scored 30 (not out) from 16 deliveries.</li><br>
        <li>On 2 October 2015, during the South African tour of India, Sharma scored 106 in the first Twenty20 international at HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala. With that, he became the second Indian cricketer to have scored centuries in all three formats of international cricket.</li><br>
        <li>In December 2017, in a series against Sri Lanka, Sharma scored the joint-fastest T20I century, in 35 balls, ending with 118 from 43 deliveries, equaling the record of David Miller. This was also his second century in Twenty20 internationals.</li><br>
